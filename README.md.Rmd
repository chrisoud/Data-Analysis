####This repo focuses on my data analysis project! 

The project is focused on health statistics about different cereal products!
The information was further condensed to manufacturer. 

This makes this data analysis focused on the health correlations (if any) between the manufacturer (mfr) of cereal and the cereal products themselves!

The original dataset was cleaned up a bit. Much of the data that was very similar was removed as so many categories existed in the raw file. This included fat, protein, vitamins, etc.

What was left was Name,Manufacturer, Calories, Sodium, Sugars, and Potassium.

Only 6 mfrs were used for this data analysis

Mfr Key
G = General Mills
K = Kelloggs
N = Nabisco
P = Post
Q = Quaker Oats
R = Ralston Purina
