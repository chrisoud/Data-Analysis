####It can be understood that the Manufacturer (mfr) of the cereal oftentimes does have a correlation to the health statistics. When looking at all three plots, it is apparent that Nabisco by far is the healthiest cereal manufacturer holding the lowest mean calories and sugar. Along with this, it is easy to see that all other cereal manufacturers are attempting to maintain similar statistics. When looking at the histograms for calories, it is very apparent that these manufacturers are likely attempting to meet similar health statistics. However, Quaker Oats also stands out as an outlier with lower average calories and sugar than most other manufacturers. 

####When looking at potassium, it can be noted that certain brands like General Mills don't make effort into incorportating more. On the flipside, it is notable that mfr like post and Nabisco have multiple cereals with high potassium amounts. Overall, this data analysis has proven that there are health correlations between the cereal manufacturer and their cereal products.
